Linking minecraft to python with the module from     https://www.instructables.com/id/Python-coding-for-Minecraft/

Useful for 3D ploting, SLAM illustration, building, or fun.

1- capture.py uses the scanner_live src from the 'tools' repo to plot live in Minecraft a phone's camera video feed.

2- pycraft_001.py and 3d_plot.py are an ongoing attempt at 3D-plotting objects from the quixel-megascan library (unreal engine). Using the threading module to speed up the process. Effectiveness may vary on CPUs.

3d display of point clouds, here using a model from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ih_Zz9a6UcbUlaA-puEB_is7DYvXrb4w. Colors can correspond to the point cloud, but it takes longer to appear in game.

Chose Zuckerberg because displaying pictures with the 16 colors of wools (without K-means, just least square means) gives bad results on an image with a large palette. Therefore faces yield good results:
